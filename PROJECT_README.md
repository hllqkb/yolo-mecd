## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   ```bash
   # Reduce batch size in training
   batch=2  # instead of batch=4

   # Use smaller image size
   imgsz=640  # instead of imgsz=1280
   ```

2. **Model Loading Errors**
   ```python
   # Verify model path
   import os
   model_path = 'runs/detect/train15/weights/best.pt'
   print(f"Model exists: {os.path.exists(model_path)}")

   # Check model integrity
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   try:
       model = YOLO(model_path)
       print("Model loaded successfully")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
   ```

3. **Web Interface Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Streamlit installation
   streamlit --version

   # Clear Streamlit cache
   streamlit cache clear

   # Run with debug mode
   streamlit run citrus_detection_app.py --logger.level=debug
   ```

4. **Performance Optimization**
   ```python
   # Enable GPU acceleration
   import torch
   device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
   model = YOLO('best.pt')
   results = model('image.jpg', device=device)

   # Batch processing for multiple images
   results = model(['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg'])
   ```

### FAQ

**Q: How to improve detection accuracy?**
A: Try adjusting confidence threshold, using higher resolution images, or fine-tuning on your specific dataset.

**Q: Can I use this for other fruit detection?**
A: Yes, but you'll need to retrain the model with your specific fruit dataset and modify the class names.

**Q: How to export the model for mobile deployment?**
```python
model = YOLO('best.pt')
model.export(format='onnx')  # For ONNX
model.export(format='tflite')  # For TensorFlow Lite
```

**Q: How to train on custom dataset?**
A: Prepare your dataset in YOLO format, update the citdet.yaml file with your paths and class names, then run the training script.
